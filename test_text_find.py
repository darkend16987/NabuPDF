"""Tests for the read half of Find & Replace (/text-find, /text-find-bin).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every way this endpoint can be wrong is quiet. It cannot crash the
app and it cannot produce a visibly broken PDF on its own — it hands the renderer a
list of offsets, and the renderer faithfully writes to whatever those offsets point
at. So a boundary computed against the wrong string does not raise; it replaces four
characters in the middle of a different word, in a contract, and nobody finds out.

The two bugs that motivated the file, both found by measuring a real document:

  * A match was declared a "whole word" if it started at the beginning of its SPAN.
    A line drawn as ["AB", "2026"] therefore reported `2026` as a whole word AND as
    replaceable, and replacing it corrupted `AB2026`.
  * Whitespace-only spans were dropped before the line was joined. PyMuPDF makes one
    of those whenever a line is drawn in pieces with a cursor jump — very common in
    exported/justified text — so "Hợp đồng" simply could not be found.

Half the cases run against a hand-built index (no PDF at all): that is the layer the
arithmetic lives in, and building it by hand is the only way to state a case like
"two spans, identical style, 0.0001pt apart" exactly. The rest go through real PDFs
so the index builder itself is covered.

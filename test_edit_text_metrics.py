"""Tests for the SIZE of the text /edit-text draws back — reported as "chữ to ra".

A PDF very often draws its text condensed: a `Tz` in the content stream, a text
matrix that is narrower than it is tall, or simply a narrow face whose substitute
on this machine is wider. `insert_text` knows none of that — it always draws at the
font's own natural advances — so the replacement comes out longer than the line it
replaced and runs into whatever sits after it.

Measured on the invoice that prompted this: every span drawn at ~0.84 of Times New
Roman's natural width, so a "keep the font" edit redrew ~24% too long. (Before the
font fix it was worse, ~58%, because the DejaVu fallback is wider still than Times —
which is why this only became the obvious defect once the font was right.)

The correction measures the ORIGINAL string in the font about to be drawn and scales
x by whatever factor puts it back at the width it had. Derived from the old text
only, so a longer replacement grows normally rather than being squeezed into the old
box — this is not "fit to the box".

Fixtures build the condensed case with the same morph mechanism the fix uses, which
is how a squeeze is expressed in a PDF's text matrix.

//   • N document WebContentsViews below it — each loads the UNCHANGED
//     renderer/index.html, so every tab is a full, independent PDF renderer with
//     its own singular `state`, history, autosave and recovery. Only the ACTIVE
//     document view is attached to the content tree at a time; inactive views
//     stay alive (their renderer keeps running) but detached.
//
// This isolates the tab change to the window layer: the battle-tested per-doc
// renderer is reused verbatim, one instance per tab.
//
// main.js injects its process-level helpers via configure() so this module stays
// free of app wiring (no circular require).

// ---- page drop classification (pure) ---------------------------------------

// What does a PAGE drop at `point` mean? Same shape and spirit as classifyDrop —
// plain numbers, no Electron, no DOM, unit-tested (test/page-drop.test.js) —
// but over the DOCUMENT views instead of the tab strips, because a page lands in
// another document's page column, not in its tab strip.
//
//   rects     [{ key, rect, z, panes }] — every visible window's document view,
//             source included. `z` is the focus-recency stamp; among the windows
//             under the cursor the HIGHEST z wins, which is how an overlap resolves
//             to the window the user can actually see there. `panes` (optional) is
//             that window's READ-ONLY split-view rectangles.
//   sourceKey the window the pages are being dragged from
//
// Four outcomes, and the two harmless ones are deliberately identical to
// "do nothing":
//   self     — ended inside its own window: the in-column reorder that has shipped
//              since v0.2.41 owns this gesture, and this feature must never take it
//              over (BI-57). Main sends nothing at all.
//   send     — hand the pages to that window.
//   readonly — ended on a split-view pane. Those panes never write, so they cannot
//              take pages; this is reported so the SOURCE can say why instead of
//              swallowing a gesture the user aimed carefully.
//   none     — no target (empty desktop, another app, no cursor): nothing happens.
//
// The source window's OWN panes answer "readonly" too, and that does not touch
// BI-57: the in-column reorder lives entirely inside the source renderer's DOM, and
// a pane is a different WebContentsView the renderer's drag never reaches. The
// `self` branch above still owns every point inside the source DOCUMENT.
//
// Note the missing `pad`: unlike a tab, a page has nowhere to be "torn out" to,
// so just-outside-a-window must mean nothing rather than something (P7).

/*
 * "Managed annotation" codec — the private PDF object layer behind editable
 * annotations. Lifted out of editor.js at v0.2.49; every body was verified
 * byte-identical to v0.2.48's editor.js before the move.
 *
 * WHAT A MANAGED ANNOT IS. Text boxes, comment notes, arrows, inserted images and —
 * since v0.2.61/v0.2.63 — rectangles, ovals, revision clouds and freehand strokes are written as
 * REAL PDF annotations (so
 * Foxit/Acrobat show them) that ALSO carry a private `/NabuData` payload, plus — for
 * images — a `/NabuSrc` stream holding the ORIGINAL image file bytes. Re-opening the
 * file reads those back and rebuilds live, editable overlay objects instead of finding
 * flattened pixels.
 *
 * TWO FLAVOURS OF APPEARANCE, and the difference is worth knowing before editing here:
 * text / arrow / image carry a RASTER `/AP` (a PNG), because their ink is Vietnamese
 * glyphs or the user's own photo. box / ellipse / cloud / cloudpen / draw carry a VECTOR `/AP`
 * built from pdf-lib's own operator generators — see shapeAppearance(). The vector ones own
 * no image and no `/NabuSrc`, so the two invariants below are about the raster half of the
 * family.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE (docs/REGRESSION-GUARD.md §1, BI-37 / BI-38). This is
 * the highest-consequence code in the editor: a mistake here does not look like a bug,
 * it looks like the user's inserted image quietly disappearing from their contract, or
 * the file doubling in size on every save. Two invariants carry that weight:
 *   · `managedSrcBytes` returns null — meaning "LEAVE THIS ANNOT ALONE" — for anything
 *     that doesn't look exactly like our own output. A foreign editor that re-compressed
 *     our stream makes the annot read-only, never deleted.
 *   · `stripManagedFromPage` takes `trash` and defers freeing to `freeManagedTrash`,
 *     because ONE image source is shared by every page "Áp ảnh cho nhiều trang" put it
 *     on. Freeing mid-loop makes page 2's lookup return null → its annot is kept AND
 *     re-written → two stamps for one image. The parameter is not optional politeness.
 *
 * EXPOSURE — the `wire.js` tier of §2 (bare names at classic-script top level), same as
 * annot-text.js / annot-geom.js: the call sites in editor.js did not change, so its side
 * of the move is a pure deletion. `module.exports` for node, `window.ManagedCodec` for a
 * probe. MUST be loaded BEFORE editor.js (and AFTER wire.js + annot-text.js).
 *
 * WHAT DELIBERATELY STAYED IN editor.js:
 *   · `deserializeManaged` — mints ids from `ed.seq`, so it needs editor state.
 *   · `addManagedAnnot` (and its `f` formatter) — calls the canvas rasterisers
 *     `renderTextPng` / `renderArrowPng`, so it cannot run outside a browser.
 *   · `URL_TOKEN` — belongs to the undo snapshot pool, not to this codec.

  // ---- placing an appearance on a page that carries /Rotate ----------------
  //
  // THE PROBLEM these three solve. A managed annot's appearance is a Form XObject
  // placed by its `/Rect`, which lives in UNROTATED user space — the viewer applies
  // `/Rotate` to page content and annotations alike, afterwards. So on a rotated page
  // an appearance written the naive way comes out spun (and in the wrong place), which
  // is why text / arrow / image used to answer `false` there and fall through to being
  // flattened into pixels. Flattened is irreversible: nothing is left for
  // importManaged() to read, so every text box on a rotated page was permanently
  // un-editable — including on any page the user rotated with our own "Xoay trang".
  //
  // THE FIX, and why it needs no new constant. The `/AP` content is
  // `q w 0 0 h 0 0 cm /NabuImg Do Q`: the unit square scaled to (w,h) in FORM space.
  // The flattened path emits `translate(bx,by) · R(angle) · scale(w,h)`. Balance the
  // two and the appearance's own matrix falls out as `/Matrix = R(angle)` with the
  // translation `(bx, by)` — the anchor `map(a.x, a.y + a.h)` already computes. Then by
  // PDF 32000-1 §12.5.5 the viewer bounds `Matrix × BBox`, maps that box onto `/Rect`,
  // and draws through both — so `/Rect` must be exactly that bbox moved to the anchor,
  // or the viewer would SCALE the appearance to fit and distort it.
  //
  // MEASURED, not derived on paper: `npm run test:rotate` bakes the same annot onto
  // four pages differing only in /Rotate, composes the real CTM out of the content
  // stream, and checks the annotation lands on the same DISPLAY-space quad as the
  // flattened path — at 0/90/180/270, with the /AP mapping scale pinned at exactly 1
  // in both axes. See docs/SPEC-annot-rotated.md §5.
  //
  // At 0° `apMatrixFor` is the identity and `apRectFor` returns `[bx, by, bx+w, by+h]`
  // — byte-for-byte what shipped before this existed. addManagedAnnot writes no
  // `/Matrix` at all in that case, so unrotated documents (very nearly all of them) are
  // untouched. Do not "simplify" that guard away. BI-59.

  // ---- vector appearances (box / ellipse) ---------------------------------
  //
  // WHY THESE TWO ARE NOT RASTERISED. text and arrow put a PNG in their `/AP` because
  // their ink is Vietnamese glyphs, and embedding a font that renders "Nghiệm thu" is a
  // problem we deliberately do not have. A rectangle and an oval have no such excuse:
  // pdf-lib EXPORTS the very operator generators `page.drawRectangle` / `page.drawEllipse`
  // call internally, so the appearance can be the SAME path the flattened writer emits —
  // just inside a Form XObject instead of the page content stream. That buys three things
  // a canvas could not: it stays sharp at any zoom and on paper, it costs a few dozen
  // bytes instead of a supersampled bitmap, and — because the geometry comes from the
  // same function — the round-trip cannot drift away from `drawOneAnnot`'s output.
  //
  // `stroke` / `fill` are pdf-lib rgb() objects, NOT hex: hexRgb lives in editor.js and
  // this file stays free of it, the same way it stays free of the canvas rasterisers.
  // `fill` null means stroke-only, which is the common case.
  //
  // THE PADDING IS LOAD-BEARING. A `/AP` form CLIPS to its `/BBox`, and half of a stroke
  // sits outside the path it follows — at a mitred rectangle corner, √2 halves. Size the
  // BBox to w×h and the user's border comes back shaved on all four sides. One full
  // stroke width covers the mitre with room to spare; the extra margin is transparent,
  // so being generous costs nothing and being exact costs a bug report.
  //
  // Fill opacity travels in an ExtGState that is written DIRECT (inline in /Resources),
  // never as a registered indirect object. That is not a style choice: collectManagedChain
  // frees `/NabuSrc`, `/NabuImg` and the form itself, and an indirect ExtGState would be a
  // fourth object nobody frees — a slow leak on every re-bake, which is exactly the class
  // of bug BI-38 exists to prevent. A direct dict dies with the form that holds it.
  //
  // ROTATION IS NOT THIS FUNCTION'S JOB, and that is the single most important line here.
  // The flattened writer must pass `rotate: pageRotate(page)` to drawSvgPath, because it
  // hands pdf-lib a LOCAL coordinate system and lets it place that system in user space —
  // forgetting it is exactly how khoanh mây came out spun on every rotated page until
  // v0.2.52 (BI-45). Inside a Form XObject the local system IS the form's own space, which
  // is display-upright by construction, and `/Matrix = R(angle)` on the form does the
  // turning. So everything below draws at `degrees(0)`, always. Passing the page angle in
  // here would rotate it TWICE.
  //
  // RETURNS `ox` / `oy` — the OVERLAY coordinates of the form's bottom-left corner — so the
  // caller maps one point and never has to know which kind's padding rule applied. That is
  // deliberate: `pad` means different things to a box (half a mitred stroke) and to a cloud
  // (a whole scallop bump PLUS the stroke), and a caller re-deriving the anchor per kind is
  // four chances to be off by one stroke width. Returns null for a degenerate freehand
  // cloud (<3 distinct points), which means "flatten this one" — cloudPathPoly says the
  // same thing to drawOneAnnot, so both writers agree to draw nothing.

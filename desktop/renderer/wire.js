 * Nabu PDF — codec for binary payloads on the sidecar wire (pure, no DOM).
 *
 * Split out of app.js for the same reason page-range.js was: this is logic where
 * a mistake is SILENT. Get the chunk size wrong and every request still looks
 * fine in the debugger — it just carries corrupt base64, and the failure surfaces
 * as "the PDF came back damaged" far from the cause. Being DOM-free makes it
 * testable under plain node (desktop/test/wire-codec.test.js), which the rest of
 * app.js is not (docs/REGRESSION-GUARD.md §1).
 *
 * LOAD ORDER MATTERS DIFFERENTLY HERE than in page-range.js: callers use the
 * BARE names (`pdfJsonBody(...)`, `b64ToU8(...)`) from app.js, text-edit.js and
 * compare.js — 16 call sites that predate this file. Declaring them at the top
 * level of a classic <script> puts them in the shared global scope exactly as
 * before, so moving the code changed no call site (BI-14: renaming them WOULD).
 * `window.Wire` mirrors the same functions as a checkable handle for probes.
 *
 * See BI-24 for why there is deliberately no general-purpose "encode this
 * Uint8Array to base64" helper anywhere in the renderer.

// Build the JSON request body for a sidecar call that carries the whole PDF,
// WITHOUT ever holding the payload as one JS string.
//
// There is deliberately NO "encode this Uint8Array to base64" helper any more.
// The obvious `JSON.stringify({ pdf_b64: <base64 of bytes>, ...fields })` costs
// three full-size copies on the renderer heap: the binary string built while
// encoding, the base64 it produces, and stringify's copy of that into the final
// body. On a 134 MB document that is ~500 MB of transient strings on top of
// state.bytes and the undo history — the same heap exhaustion v0.2.40 fixed for
// the DOWNLOAD direction and left standing here. Keeping a general-purpose
// encoder around is what let that pattern get written in the first place, so the
// streaming builders below are the only way to put binary on the wire.
//
// A Blob assembled from pieces keeps its bytes in Blink's blob store (spillable to
// disk), not on the JS heap. The wire format is unchanged — the sidecar still receives
// ordinary JSON — so this is purely a renderer-side memory fix with no API surface to
// keep in step.
//
// "Only one 48 KB chunk is ever live as a string" was what this comment used to claim, and
// it was not true: the chunks were collected in `parts` and only handed to `new Blob(parts)`
// at the very end, so every one of them stayed a JS string until then - a 120 MB payload
// cost +161 MB of heap right before the Blob was built (measured in Chromium with precise
// memory info; M6 in docs/REVIEW-2026-10-01). pushB64Chunks now folds the pieces gathered so
// far into a Blob every B64_FLUSH_PARTS chunks, so at most ~16 MB of base64 text is ever on
// the heap whatever the payload size.
//
// The chunk size MUST stay a multiple of 3: base64 only pads at the end of a
// stream, so chunking on a 3-byte boundary lets the pieces be concatenated
// verbatim. (49152 is also under the ~65535 argument ceiling of Function.apply.)
//
// `bins` is either a Uint8Array (sent as "pdf_b64") or an object of
// field-name → Uint8Array, for the compare endpoints that carry two documents at
// once — the heaviest call in the app, and the one that most needs this.
// Chunk size for streaming base64 into Blob pieces. MUST stay a multiple of 3 —
// see the note above. (Also under the ~65535 argument ceiling of Function.apply.)
